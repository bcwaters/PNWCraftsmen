            Decks should be pleasing to the eye,
            increase the amount of space utilized on your property, and add value to your home.

            As a deck ages it no longer meets those criteria.  The deck boards look old, the framing may be
            too deteriorated to walk on, and utimately the deck becomes a liabibilty to your home.

            <br/><br/>

            Our work on decks ranges from new builds to resurfacing to simple repairs.  We work with wood
            and composite.
