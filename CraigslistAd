New fencing business offering huge discounts.

I am an experienced carpenter starting my own business for the first time.  
I'm licensed, insured, bonded and ready to build.  I am seeking my first clients to
grow my company's reputation.

I understand that nobody wants the headache of dealing with a lousy contractor and 
as a new business I have the greatest incentive to provide you the best experience possible.

What can I offer you that the other guys can't?
    * Prompt start date and timely completion of the job.  I am taking only one client at a time.
    * Quality work. Quality material. All work is done by me and under my supervision. I need
    * Incredibly pricing.  The most valuable thing to me is referals,
        instead of spending money on marketing I'm lowering my prices.
    * A clean and orderly execution of the job.  No trampled plants, no unnecasary mess. Each job is treated like a photoshoot. 
   

If want a nice new cedar fence or just repairs I am your guy.
    *6 ft wood fencing for less the $30 per ft (this includes demo, materails and installation) 
    *Post repair $150 (I will remove the old post, put in a new one, and attach the existing fence to it)
    *Gates for $200
